Piwik Analytics
===============

Extension for Bolt CMS to easily track your site visits and statistics.
These metrics can be used to get to know your public and optimize the
site towards actual usage.

Configuration
-------------
piwikurl: This is the URL of your Piwik server.
	Use "http://", "https://" or "//". The last option uses the same 
	protocol as the tracked page to connect to Piwik. Make sure both
	are accepted by the Piwik host.
	
piwiksiteid: The ID of the site to track. Make sure this is correct or
	your statistics will end up in another site in Piwik.

Roadmap
-------
Support configuration of roles to exclude from tracking.
